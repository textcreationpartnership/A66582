         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Province OF CAROLINA IN AMERICA.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>CAROLINA,</hi> is that part of <hi>Florida,</hi> which lies between <hi>twenty nine</hi> and <hi>thirty ſix De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> and <hi>thirty Minutes</hi> of <hi>Northern La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:</hi> On the <hi>Eaſt</hi> it is waſhed with the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> and is bounded on the <hi>Weſt</hi> by <hi>Mare Pacificum</hi> (or the South Sea) and within theſe bounds is contained the moſt healthy Fertile and pleaſant part of <hi>Florida,</hi> which is ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spaniſh Authors.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Carolina,</hi> was in the Year 1663. Granted by <hi>Letters Pattents</hi> in Propriety of his moſt Gracious <hi>Majeſty,</hi> unto the Right Honourable <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95841:4"/>Earl of Clarendon, George</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Craven, John</hi> Lord <hi>Berkely, Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Lord <hi>Aſhly,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>George Carteret,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Colleton,</hi> Knights and Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Sir <hi>William Berkeley</hi> Knight, by which Letters Pattents the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are to be of force in <hi>Carolina:</hi> but the <hi>Lords Proprietors</hi> have power with the conſent of the Inhabitants to make By-Laws for the better Government of the ſaid <hi>Province:</hi> So that no Money can be raiſed or Law made, without the conſent of the Inhabitants or their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. They have alſo power to appoint and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power Governours, and other Magiſtrates to Grant Liberty of Conſcience, make Conſtitutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With many other great Priviledges, as by the ſaid Letters Pattents will more largely appear. And the ſaid Lords Proprietors have there ſetled a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, whereby is granted Liberty of Conſcience, and wherein all poſſible care is taken for the equal Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and for the laſting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>By the care and endeavours of the ſaid Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonys have been ſetled in this <hi>Province,</hi> the one at <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle</hi> in the moſt Northerly part, the other at <hi>Aſhly</hi> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees odd Minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albemarle</hi> bordering upon <hi>Virginia,</hi> and only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it in Health, Fertility, and Mildneſs of the Winter, is in the Growths, Productions, and other things much of the ſame nature with it: Wherefore I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a perticular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that part; but apply my ſelf principally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95841:4"/>to diſcourſe of the Collony at <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> which being many Degrees more Southward than <hi>Virginia,</hi> differs much from it in the Nature of its Clymate and Productions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhly-River</hi> was firſt ſetled in <hi>April</hi> 1670, the Lords Proprietors having at their ſole charge, ſet out three Veſſels, with a conſiderable number of able Men; eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Cloths, Tools, Ammunition, and what elſe was thought neceſſary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to ſupply the Collony for divers years after, until the Inhabitants were able by their own Induſtry to live of themſelves; in which condition they have been for divers years paſt, and are arrived to a very great Degree of Plenty of all ſorts of Proviſions. Inſomuch, that moſt ſorts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the Engliſh Collonys, and they are plentifully enough ſupplied with all things from <hi>England</hi> or other Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> about ſeven Miles in from the Sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it ſelf into two Branches; the Southermoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the name of <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> the North Branch is called <hi>Cooper-River.</hi> In <hi>May,</hi> 1680. the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors ſent their Orders to the Government there, appointing the Port-Town for theſe two Rivers to be Built on the Poynt of Land that divides them, and to be called <hi>Charles</hi> Town, ſince which time about an hundred Houſes are there Built, and more are Building daily by the Perſons of all ſorts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern Engliſh Collonys, and the Sugar Iſlands, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and many Perſons who went to <hi>Carolina</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, being Induſtrious ſince they came out of their times with their Maſters, at whoſe charge they were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95841:5"/>Tranſported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here alſo Built Houſes, and exerciſe their Trades: And many that went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that condition, are now worth ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their Eſtates ſtill encreaſing. And Land is become of that value near the Town, that it is ſold for twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and not cleared of the reſt, and Land that is clear'd and fitted for Planting, and Fenced, is let for ten Shillings <hi>per annum</hi> the Acre, though twenty miles diſtant from the Town, and ſix men will in ſix weeks time, Fall, Clear, Fence in, and fit for Planting, ſix Acres of Land.</p>
            <p>At this Town, in <hi>November,</hi> 1680. There Rode at one time ſixteen Sail of Veſſels (ſome of which were upwards of 200 Tuns) that came from divers parts of the Kings Dominions to trade there, which great concourſe of ſhipping, will undoubtebly in a ſhort time make it a conſiderable Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſtern Shore of America,</hi> whether it be by reaſon of its having the great Body of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Weſtward of it, and by conſequence the Northweſt-Wind (which Flows contrary to the Sun) the Freezing-Wind, as the North-Eaſt is in <hi>Europe,</hi> or that the Frozen Lakes which Lye-in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Canada,</hi> and lye <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> from the Shore, Impregnate the Freezing Wind with more chill and congealing qnalities, or that the uncultivated Earth, covered for the moſt part with large ſhading Trees, breathes forth more nitrous Vapours, than that which is cultivated; or all theſe Reaſons together, it is certainly much more cold than any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the ſame Degree of Latitude of thirty nine and forty,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95841:5"/>and more <hi>North,</hi> though above ſix hundred Miles nearer the Sun than <hi>England;</hi> is notwithſtanding, many Degrees colder in the Winter.</p>
            <p>The Author having been informed by thoſe that ſay they have ſeen it, that in thoſe Parts it Freezeth above ſix Inches thick in a Night, and great Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Rivers are Frozen over in the ſame ſpace of time; and the Country about <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> though within nine Degrees of the <hi>Tropick,</hi> hath ſeldom any Winter that doth not produce ſome Ice, though I cannot yet learn that any hath been ſeen on Rivers or Ponds, above a quarter of an Inch thick, which vaniſheth as ſoon as the Sun is an hour or two high, and when the Wind is not at <hi>North-weſt,</hi> the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is very mild. So that the <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> of <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> I ſuppoſe to be of the ſame Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature with the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> and beginning of <hi>April</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> this ſmall Winter cauſeth a fall of the Leaf, and adapts the Country to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all the Grains and Fruits of <hi>England,</hi> as well as thoſe that require more Sun; inſomuch, that at <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> the Apple, the Pear, the Plum, the Quince, Apricock, Peach, Medlar, Walnut, Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Cheſnut, thrive very well in the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, together with the Orange, the Lemon, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, the Pomgranate, the Fig and Almond; nor is the Winter here Cloudy, Overcaſt, or Foggy, but it hath been obſerved that from the twentieth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> to the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> including all the Winter Months, there have been but eight overcaſt days, and though Rains fall pretty often in the Winter, it is moſt commonly in quick Showers, which when paſt, the Sun ſhines out clear again.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95841:6"/>
            <p>The Summer is not near ſo hot as in <hi>Virginia,</hi> or the other Northern American Engliſh Collonys, which may hardly gain belief with thoſe that have not conſidered the reaſon; which is its neerneſs to the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> which makes it in a greater meaſure than thoſe parts more Northward partake of thoſe Breezes, which almoſt conſtantly riſe about eight or nine of the Clock, within the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> and blow freſh from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> till about four in the Afternoon; and a little after the Sea-breeze dys away, there ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes a North-wind, which blowing all night, keeps it freſh and cool. In ſhort, I take <hi>Carolina</hi> to be much of the ſame nature with thoſe delicious Countries about <hi>Aleppo, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna:</hi> but hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being under an equal Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Such, who in this Country have ſeated themſelves near great Marſhes, are ſubject to Agues, as thoſe are who are ſo ſeated in <hi>England:</hi> but ſuch who are planted more remote from Marſhes or ſtanding Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are exceeding healthy; inſomuch, that out of a Family conſiſting of never leſs than twelve Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not one hath died ſince their firſt Arrival there, which is nine years: but what is more, not one hath been ſick in all that time; nor is there one of the Maſters of Families that went over in the firſt Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, dead of ſickneſs in <hi>Carolina,</hi> except one, who was ſeventy and five years of Age before he came there; though the number of thoſe Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies be pretty conſiderable: divers perſons that went out of <hi>England</hi> Ptiſical, and Conſumptive, have recover'd, and others ſubject in <hi>England</hi> to frequent fits of the Stone, have been abſolutely freed from them after they have been there a ſhort time; nor is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95841:6"/>the Gout there yet known. The Ayr gives a ſtrony Appetite and quick Digeſtion, nor is it witetlh ſuitable effects, men finding themſelves apparntly more lightſome, more prone, and more able to al Youthful Exerciſes, than in <hi>England,</hi> the Women are very Fruitful, and the Children have freſh San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Complexions.</p>
            <p>The Soyle is generally very fertile, but hath ſome ſandy tracts ſo as to make an agreable variety, but even this Land produceth good Corne and is excellent paſture; Wheat, <hi>Rye, Barly, Oates,</hi> and Peas, thrive exceedingly, and the ground yeilds in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than in <hi>England, Turnips, Parſnips, Carrots, Potatoes,</hi> and <hi>Edoes,</hi> a ſubſtantial wholeſome nouriſhing Root growes well, and all excellent in their kindes they have near twenty ſorts of Pulſe that we have not in <hi>England,</hi> all of them very good food, inſomuch that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garden Bean is not regarded.</p>
            <p>Near the Sea the Trees are not very large, they grow pritty neare together; farther up they are larger, and grow farther aſunder, and are in moſt parts free from Underwood, ſo that you may ſee near half a mile amongſt the bodyes of large tall timber trees, whoſe tops meeting make a very pleaſing ſhade, yet hinders not graſs, myrtle and other ſweet ſcenting ſhrubs here and there from growing under them: Amongſt theſe Groves of Timber Trees are here and there Savana's, (or graſsy plains) of ſeverall magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes clear of Trees, which hath occaſion'd ſome that have ſeene them to compare <hi>Carolina</hi> to thoſe pleaſant Parks in <hi>England,</hi> that have abundance of tall Timber Trees unlop'd, here you may hunt the Hare, Fox, and Deere all day long in the ſhade, and freely
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95841:7"/>ſpur your horſe through the <hi>Woods</hi> to follow the chaſe.</p>
            <p>This Country hath the Oak, Aſh, Elm, Poplar, Beech, and all the other ſorts of uſefull Timber that <hi>England</hi> hath, and divers ſorts of laſting Timber that <hi>England</hi> hath not, as Cedar white and red, Cypreſs, Locuſt, Bay and Laurell Trees, equal to the biggeſt Oaks, large Mirtles, Hickery, black Wallnut, and Pynes big enough to Maſt the greateſt Ships, and divers other ſorts, which I cannot enumerate.</p>
            <p>The woods abound with <hi>Hares, Squirrels, Ratoons Poſsums, Conyes</hi> and <hi>Deere,</hi> which laſt are ſo plenty that an Indian hunter hath kill'd nine fatt Deere in a day all ſhott by himſelf, and all the conſiderable Planters have an Indian hunter which they hire for jeſs than twenty ſhillings a year, and one hunter will very well find a Family of thirty people with as much Veniſon and Foul, as they can well eat. Here are alſo in the woods great plenty of wilde <hi>Turkeys, Partridges,</hi> ſomething ſmaller than thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> but more deicate, <hi>Turtle Doves, Paraquetos,</hi> and <hi>Pidgeons:</hi> On the graſsy plaines the whiſtling <hi>Plover</hi> and <hi>Cranes</hi> and divers ſorts of Birds unknowne in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carolina</hi> doth ſo abound in Rivers, that within fifty miles of the Sea you can hardly place your ſelf ſeven miles from a Navigable River, and divers are naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for good big Veſſels above three hundred miles: The Rivers abound with variety of excellent Fiſh, and near the Sea with very good Oyſters, in many of which are Pearl: the Author having ſeen Pearl that have been taken out of ſome of them bigger than Rouncival Peaſe, and perfectly round. On the Rivers and brooks are all the winter moneths vaſt quantitys of <hi>Swan, wild Geeſe, Duck, Widgeon, Teale, Curlew, Snype, Shell Drake,</hi> and a certaine ſort <hi>of black
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95841:7"/>Duck</hi> that is excellent meat, and ſtayes there all the year.</p>
            <p>Neat Cattle thrive and increaſe here exceedingly, there being perticular Planters that have already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight hundred head, and will in a few years in all probability, have as many thouſands, unleſs they ſell ſome part; the Cattle are not ſubject to any Diſeaſe as yet perceiv'd, and are fat all the Year long without any Fother, the little Winter they have, not pinching them ſo as to be perceiv'd, which is a great advantage the Planters here have of the more Northern Plantations who are all forc'd to give their Cattle Fother, and muſt ſpend a great part of their Summers Labour in providing three or four Months Fother for their Cattle in the Winter, or elſe would have few of them alive in the Spring, which will keep them from ever having very great Heards, or be able to do much in Planting any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for Forreign Markets; the providing Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Food for their Cattle, taking up ſo much of their Summers Labour; So that many Judicious Perſons think that <hi>Carolina</hi> will be able by Sea, to ſupply thoſe Northern Collonys, with ſalted Beef for their Shipping, cheaper than they themſelves with what is bred amongſt them; for, conſidering that all the Woods in <hi>Carolina</hi> afford good Paſturage, and the ſmall <hi>Rent</hi> that is paid to the <hi>Lords Proprietors</hi> for Land, an Ox is raiſed at almoſt as little expence in <hi>Carolina,</hi> as a Hen is in <hi>England.</hi> And it hath by experience been found that Beef will take ſalt at <hi>Aſhly-River</hi> any Month in the Year, and ſave very well.</p>
            <p>Ewes have moſt commonly two or three Lambs at a time; their Wool is a good Staple, and they thrive
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95841:8"/>very well, but require a Shepherd to drive them to Feed, and to bring them home at night to preſerve them from the Wolves.</p>
            <p>Hogs increaſe in <hi>Carolina</hi> abundantly, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without any charge or trouble to the Planter, only to make them Sheds, wherein they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from the Sun and Rain, and Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening to give them a little Indian Corn, or the pickings and parings of <hi>Potatoes, Turnips,</hi> or other Roots, and at the ſame time blowing a Horn, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any other conſtant noyſe, to which being us'd, they will afterwards upon hearing it, repair home, the reſt of their Food they get in the Woods, of Maſts, and Nuts of ſeveral ſorts; and when thoſe fail, they have Graſs and Roots enough, the ground being never frozen ſo hard as to keep them from Rooting, theſe conveniencies breeds them large, and in the Maſt time they are very fat, all which makes the rearing them ſo eaſy, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Planters that are ſingle and have never a Servant, that have two or three hundred Hogs, of which they make great profit; <hi>Barbados, Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> affording a conſtant good price for their Pork; by which means they get wherewithal to build them more convenient Houſes, and to purchaſe Servants, and <hi>Negro-ſlaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There have</hi> been imported into <hi>Carolina,</hi> about an hundred and fifty Mares, and ſome Horſes from <hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> which breeds well, and the Coalts they have are finer Lim'd and Headed than their Dams or Sires, which gives great hopes of an excellent breed of Horſes, as ſoon as they have gotten good Stalions amongſt them.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95841:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Negros,</hi> By reaſon of the mildneſs of the Winter thrive and ſtand much better, than in any of the more Northern Collonys, &amp; require leſs clothes, which is a great charge ſav'd.</p>
            <p>With the Indians the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a perfect freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they being both uſefull to one another. And care is taken by the <hi>Lords Proprietors,</hi> that no Injuſtice ſhall be done them; In order to which they have eſtabliſhed a particular Court of Judicature, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of the ſobereſt and moſt diſintereſsed Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) to determine all differnces that ſhall happen between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and any of the <hi>Indians,</hi> this they do upon a Chriſtian and Moral Conſideration, and not out of any apprehenſion of danger from them, for the <hi>Indians</hi> have been always ſo ingaged in Wars one Town or Village againſt another (their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being uſually of no greater extent) that they have not ſuffered any increaſe of People, there having been ſeveral Nations in a manner quite extirpated by Wars amongſt themſelves ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſetled at <hi>Aſhly</hi> River: This keeps them ſo thin of people, and ſo divided, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of danger from them; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being already too ſtrong for all the <hi>Indians</hi> within five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles of them, if they were united, and this the <hi>Indians</hi> as well know, that they will never dare to break with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or do an Injury to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, for fear of having it reveng'd upon their whole Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords Proprietors</hi> do at preſent grant to all perſons that come there to Inhabit as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> To each Maſter or Miſtriſs of a Family fifty acres, and for every able ſon or man ſervant they ſhall carry or cauſe to be tranſported into <hi>Carolina</hi> fifty acres more, and the like for each Daughter or woman ſervant that

But foraſmuch as divers perſons who are already Inhabitants of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and others that have Intentions to tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into that <hi>Province,</hi> deſire not to be cumber'd with paying of a Rent, and alſo to ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good large convenient tracts of Land, without being forc'd to bring thither a great number of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at one time; The <hi>Lords Proprietors</hi> have been Prevail'd upon, and have agreed to ſell to thoſe who have a mind to buy Land, after the rate of fifty pound for a Thouſand Acres, reſerving a Pepper-Corn <hi>per annum</hi> Rent when demanded.</p>
            <p>The way of any ones taking up his Land, due to him either by carrying himſelf or ſervants into the Country, or by purchaſing it of the <hi>Lords Proprietors,</hi> is after this manner: He firſt ſeeks out a place to his mind that is not already poſſeſſed by any other, then applyes himſelf to the Governour and Proprietors Deputys, and ſhew what rights he hath to Land, either by Purchaſe or otherwiſe; who thereupon iſſue out their Warrant to the Surveyor-General to meaſure him out a Plantation containing the number of acres due to him; who making Certificate that he hath meaſur'd out ſo much Land and the Bounds, a Deed is prepar'd of courſe, which is ſigned by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the Lords Proprietors Deputys, and the <hi>Proprietors</hi> Seal affixed to it and Regiſter'd, which is is a good Conveyance in Law of the Land therein mention'd to the party and his Heirs for ever.</p>

            <p>I have here, as I take it, deſcribed a pleaſant &amp; fertile Country, abounding in health and pleaſure, and with all things neceſsary for the ſuſtenance of mankind, and wherein I think I have written nothing but truth, ſure I am I have inſerted no wilful falſhood: I have alſo told you how men are to have Land that go there to Inhabit. But a rational man will certainly inquire, When I have Land, what ſhall I doe with it? what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditys ſhall I be able to produce that will yeild me mony in other Countrys, that I may be inabled to buy <hi>Negro</hi> ſlaves (without which a Planter can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do any great matter) and purchaſe other things for my pleaſure and convenience, that <hi>Carolina</hi> doth not produce? To this I anſwer, That beſides the great profit that will be made by the vaſt heards of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Swine, the Country appears to be proper for the Commoditys following. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wine. There are growing</hi> naturally in the Country five ſorts of Grapes, three of which the French Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naroons who are there, judge will make very good Wine, and ſome of the <hi>Lords Proprietors</hi> have taken care to ſend plants of the <hi>Rheniſh, Canary, Clarret, Muſcatt, Madera,</hi> and Spaniſh <hi>Grapes,</hi> of all which divers Vinyards are planted; ſome wine was made this year that proved very good both in colour and taſte, and an indifferent good quantity may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the next year: The Country hath gentle riſing hills of fertile ſand proper for Vines, and farther from the Sea, rock and gravel, on which very good grapes grow naturally, ripen well, and together, and very luſhious in taſte, inſomuch as the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants who are there, and skill'd in wine, do no way doubt of producing great quantitys and very good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oyl. There are</hi> ſeverall <hi>Olive</hi> trees growing, which were carryed thither, ſome from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Bermeudas</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95841:10"/>and flouriſh excedingly, and the Inhabitants take great care to propagate more, ſo that in all probability it will be an excellent Oyl-Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silk.</hi> There is in <hi>Carolina</hi> great plenty of <hi>Mulberry</hi> Trees, ſuch as are by experience found to feed the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm very well, yea as well as the white Mulberry, but there is of that ſort alſo, which are propagated with a great deal of eaſe, a ſtick new cut and thruſt into the ground, ſeldom failing to grow, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the Seed if them be ſown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tobacco. Tobacco</hi> doth here grow very well, and is nearer to the nature of the <hi>Spaniſh Tobacco</hi> than that of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indigo. Indigo</hi> thrives well here, and very good hath been made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cotton. Cotton</hi> of the <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſort will grow well, and good plenty of the Seed is ſent thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flax &amp; Hemp</hi> Thrives exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Good plenty of Pitch and Tar is there made, there being particular perſons that have made above a thouſand barrels.</p>
            <p>Here is great plenty of Oake for Pipe ſtaves, which are a good Commodity in the <hi>Maderas, Canaryes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Leeward Iſlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sumack. Sumack</hi> growes in great abundance natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſo undoubtedly would <hi>Woad, Madder</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa-Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> if planted.</p>

            <p>In ſhort. This Country being of the ſame Clymate and Temperature of <hi>Aleppo, Smyrna, Antioch, Judea,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Nanking,</hi> the richeſt in <hi>China,</hi> will (I conceive) produce any thing which thoſe Countrys do, were the Seeds brought into it.</p>

            <p>The Tools that men who goe thither ought to take with them are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> An Ax, a Bill, and a broad Hoe, &amp; grabbing Hoe, for every man, and a croſs cut Saw to every four men, a Whip-ſaw, a ſet of Wedges and Fraus and Betle-Rings to every family, and ſome Reaping Hooks and Sythes, as likewiſe Nails of all ſorts, Hooks, Hinges, Bolts &amp; Locks for their Houſes.</p>

            <p>The Paſsage of a man or woman to <hi>Carolina</hi> is five Pound, Ships are going thither all times of the year.
